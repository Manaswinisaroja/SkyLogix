# 🚁 SkyLogix – Autonomous AI Drone Delivery Agent

An intelligent autonomous drone that plans optimal routes, adapts to dynamic obstacles and weather, and executes end-to-end deliveries inside a real-time 3D smart-city simulation.

---

## 🧠 Overview

SkyLogix is a **goal-driven autonomous AI agent** that simulates real-world drone logistics in a dynamic urban environment.

Instead of manually controlling the drone, the system:

- Perceives its environment  
- Makes decisions  
- Replans routes in real time  
- Completes deliveries autonomously  

This project demonstrates how **classical AI planning + robotics logic + workflow automation** can power smart-city logistics.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The drone operates as a **goal-based AI agent**:

1. **Perception** → environment, obstacles, weather, battery  
2. **Planning** → A* optimal path generation  
3. **Decision making** → safety, rerouting, emergency return  
4. **Execution** → delivery workflow
